EVENT_COMBINE_FAILURE is triggered when a player fails to makes a trade skill combine. You would typically use this event in your zone player.pl (or global_player.pl) files.

Note that this event is in addition to the typical trade skill combine messages. You can use this event to add additional flavor, trigger other events, etc.

```perl
sub EVENT_COMBINE_FAILURE {
     #:: Match Recipe 2686: "Hand Made Backpack" by ID
     if ($recipe_id == 2686) {
          #:: Send the client a message in color 15 (yellow)
          $client->Message(15,"Awww...now where are you going to put all of your stuff?");
     }
}
```
