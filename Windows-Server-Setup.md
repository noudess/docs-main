There are many guides floating around to set up a server on Windows. The best way to decide which guide to follow is by selecting the base configuration you want to work with and branch from there.

Remember that guides are just that: guides. That being said, don't expect your results to be verbatim to any particular guide if you set up differently or are deviating for one reason or another. Adapt your server for your system/requirements or ask for help if you don't know what you are doing.
