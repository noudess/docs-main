There are many guides floating around to set up a server on Windows. The best way to decide which guide to follow is by selecting the base configuration you want to work with and branch from there.

That being said, don't expect your results to be verbatim to the guide if you are deviating for one reason or another. Adapt your server for your system/requirements or ask for help if you don't know what you are doing.
