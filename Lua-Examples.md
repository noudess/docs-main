Various Lua Quest examples to give a feel for how the code works:

### NPC
```
-- Nerissa_Clothspinner
-- Makes use of the item_turnin module, string_ext module for findi and client_ext module for Client:GiveCash() and Client:Faction()

	elseif(e.message:findi("sister")) then
		e.self:QuestSay(e.other, "My sister is in the Karanas. She is a warrior. Her name is Milea. I really need her. Would you please deliver a note to her? You look able-bodied enough for the job.");
	elseif(e.message:findi("deliver a note")) then
		if(e.other:GetLevel() < 4) then

Taxes are too high and many of the guards have been sent to the outlands, leaving Qeynos vulnerable to attack. I do not feel the same way, but I fear these few may become many. I [fear for my life].");
	elseif(e.message:findi("fear for your life")) then
		e.self:QuestSay(e.other, "During a late night stroll by the pond in north Qeynos I spied a guard carrying a very large carpet on his shoulders. He approached the pond's edge and unrolled the carpet, the body of another guard rolled out and began to moan. The other guard grabbed for a long spear like weapon from his back. He drove the weapon into the man and pushed him into the pond. I screamed. He turned to me and I ran. I do not think he gave chase, too bad, he would not like to run into my [guardian] at home. I told my guardian and we both went to the pond and saw no body. He believes I was drinking too much wine. I do not drink. Now I fear for my life when I am in the streets of Qeynos.");

		e.self:QuestSay(e.other, "When my big sister left Qeynos for adventure, she left me in the hands of her old time friend Kane Bayle. Yes, the commander of the Qeynos Guards is my guardian. You would think I would be safe. Every time I tell him the rumors I hear he just ignores me. He is too busy I guess.");

end

	local item_lib = require("item_turnin");
	
	if(item_lib.check_turn_in(e.trade, {item1 = 13302})) then

-- this is an example of how to track time on an NPC.
-- time_a is declared local outside of a function to be available later.
local time_a = os.time();

function event_spawn(e)
	-- os.time(); returns an integer value in seconds.
	e.self:Shout("The time is now: "..time_a);
end

function event_say(e)
	-- time_b is local because we have no need for it to be global, though the script would work both ways
	local time_b = os.time();
	if(e.message:findi("hail")) then
		e.self:Say("The time is now: "..time_b);
		-- os.difftime(t2,t1) returns an integer value in seconds t2-t1
		local time_diff = os.difftime(time_b,time_a);
		e.self:Say("It has been "..time_diff.." seconds since I spawned");

This is an example of how to use get_characters_in_instance
```
function event_death_complete(e)
	-- get the zone instance id
	local instance_id = eq.get_zone_instance_id();
	local charid_list = eq.get_characters_in_instance(instance_id);
	-- Lua loop basics:
	-- k = key which is generally the current index of the array, not used in this example
	-- v = value for the current key, in this example it would be the character ID
	for k,v in pairs(charid_list) do
		eq.target_global("lockout_ikky_g1", "1", "H17", 0,v, 0);
	end
end

```
### Player
```

function event_click_door(e)
	local door_id = e.door:GetDoorID();
	local entity_list = eq.get_entity_list();
	e.self:Message(15,"You clicked on door: "..door_id);
	local door = entity_list:FindDoor(door_id);
	e.self:Message(15,"GetLockPick was: "..door:GetLockPick());
	if (entity_list:FindDoor(DoorID):GetLockPick() == 0) then
		door:SetLockPick(-1);
	else
		door:SetLockPick(0);
	end
	e.self:Message(15,"GetLockPick is now: "..door:GetLockPick());
