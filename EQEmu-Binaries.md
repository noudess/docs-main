This page is for users to post links to pre-compiled binaries. It is not meant to be an official distribution or mirror at this time. If you find a link that is broken or want to make a request from a particular user, contact them via PM. You, the downloader, accept all risk by downloading and using these files. Don't download unless you trust the uploader. You have been warned.

For users posting links, use standard format zipped files without password protection. Direct links only - no click-thrus, ads, etc. Uploaders should post as much info about the build as possible (OS and Architecture, Perl version, date, etc.). Unless noted by the uploader, the only files which should be included are RelWithDebugInfo versions of:
* shared_memory.exe
* world.exe
* zone.exe
* ucs.exe
* queryserv.exe
* eqlaunch.exe
* loginserver.exe
