Placeholder while I compile notes on current Live packet structure for Player Housing.

Current work is focused on detailing:
* Probable opcodes
* Packet structure for Neighborhood listing window
* * This appears to be at least three packet formats for the initial list, request for details on a specific neighborhood, and a response containing names of guilds and players with property in that neighborhood.

Should have the packet structure for the first three packets up in the next day or two.
