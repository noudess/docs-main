Boost is a set of C++ libraries required by Lua. Boost and Lua are required to run Lua-based quests. There are several quests from PEQ written in Lua.

**Homepage:** [Boost] (http://www.boost.org)

**Current Version:** [1.57.0] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.57.0/boost_1_57_0.zip/download)

**Note:** Updating to 1.57 may cause errors in object.hpp during compile. You will need to have newer Lua libraries to get the updates, so it is recommended to stick with 1.56 or earlier for now.
