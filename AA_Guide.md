## What are Alternate Advancements?
When a player reaches level 51, they unlock the option to dedicate experience they gain to be sent to Alternate Advancements. AAs are accessed inside Everquest using the default "v" hotkey. Due to the general nature of how AA's work, the [[Database Schemas|https://github.com/EQEmu/Server/wiki/Database-Schema#alternate-advancements-guide]] that represent them on the server can be slightly complex to understand.

## Legend
AA's are grouped together, and have ranks.
