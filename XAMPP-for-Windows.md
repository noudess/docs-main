**Current Version (WinXP & 2K3):** [1.82-3] (http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.8.2-3-VC9-installer.exe)

**Current Version (WinVista+ & 2008+):** [1.83-2](http://www.apachefriends.org/download.php?xampp-win32-1.8.3-2-VC11-installer.exe)

**Note:** If you are compiling a 32-bit server, you must use Perl 5.12. XAMPP comes with 5.16, so you will need to replace that component with the [appropriate version] (ActivePerl-5.12).
