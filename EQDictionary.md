EQDictionary is a collection of lookup references, accessed by specific namespaces and referenced by client or mob version.

References are tied back to the originating client definition..but, are available through an indexed lookup system.

The purpose of this system is to allow cyclic or minimum conditional evaluations in order to transform data.
